`Calc.js` is a fully responsive, theme-switchable calculator built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces without relying on frameworks or libraries. The application includes key front-end features such as:

- Custom keyboard input control and character validation

- Real-time expression parsing using eval() with basic error handling

- A modern and clean layout styled with CSS custom properties (variables)

- Dynamic theme switching (light/dark mode)

- Clipboard integration for copying results

- Accessible and keyboard-navigable design

This project reflects my focus on clean code, semantic HTML, and an understanding of responsive design and component logic.
